# Templates for WBG Open Source Catalog Requirements

These are *starting points*, not fill-in-the-blank forms. Before generating any file, read the repo's existing code, structure, and any existing docs to understand what the project actually does. Adapt language, structure, and examples to match the project type (library, CLI tool, web app, research scripts, data pipeline, etc.).

---

## README.md — How to Write a Good One

The README should feel like it was written by someone who understands the project deeply. Read the code and existing docs first.

**Project types and their README emphasis:**
- **Library/package**: Lead with a code snippet showing the main use case. Emphasize API and installation.
- **Web application**: Screenshot is important. Focus on deployment and getting the app running.
- **Research scripts / notebooks**: Emphasize data inputs/outputs, reproducibility, and what the outputs mean.
- **CLI tool**: Show command examples prominently in Getting Started.
- **Monorepo**: Show the package structure clearly, then Getting Started per component.

### Required sections (in order):

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[2-3 sentence description: what does this do and who is it for? Be specific about the problem solved.]

> **Audience**: [Optional but helpful — who will use this?]

[Screenshot or diagram — only if the project has visual output; omit if purely code/data]
![Description](docs/screenshot.png)

## [Problem / Background — if complex enough to warrant it]

[Optional: what problem does this solve and why does it matter?]

## Key Features / How It Works

[Optional but useful for non-trivial projects]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[What the user needs installed before they can use this]

### Installation

[Exact commands to install and set up]

### Usage

[One or more concrete examples showing real usage]

## Documentation

[Link to full documentation site — required. If docs don't exist yet, note they're forthcoming and link to the docs/ folder]

## Contact

[World Bank staff name + @worldbank.org email. This is required for WBG catalog endorsement.
External/personal emails won't satisfy the requirement — the contact must be a WB staff member.]

## License

[Use **one** of the following paragraphs verbatim — it must match `LICENSE` and the IGO rider file in the repo.]

**MIT + WB-IGO-RIDER.md:**

This project is licensed under the MIT License together with the World Bank IGO Rider.
The Rider is purely procedural: it reserves all privileges and immunities enjoyed by the

```

### The license notice (verbatim — do not paraphrase)

The following exact text must appear at the bottom of the README. Pick the block that matches the repo's base license and rider (see `references/checklist.md` Requirement 1g).

**MIT:**

```

```

The WB IGO Rider (MIT) must also be present. Either:
- Fetch the current text from https://github.com/worldbank/.github/blob/main/WB-IGO-RIDER.md and save as `WB-IGO-RIDER.md`
- Or create `WB-IGO-RIDER.md` that clearly references the canonical URL

## LICENSE — Apache License, Version 2.0

Use the **verbatim** Apache License, Version 2.0 text (not summarized) from the Apache Software Foundation:

- https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt

In the **APPENDIX** (end of the license), set the copyright line to something like:

```
Copyright [yyyy] The World Bank
```

The WB IGO Rider (**Apache** variant) must also be present — it is separate from the MIT rider:

- Fetch the current text from https://github.com/worldbank/.github/blob/main/WB-IGO-RIDER-APACHE.md and save as `WB-IGO-RIDER-APACHE.md` (or equivalent), or reference that canonical URL clearly in-repo.

Do **not** use `WB-IGO-RIDER.md` (MIT) with an Apache `LICENSE`; the Apache stack requires `WB-IGO-RIDER-APACHE.md`.

If third-party code requires attribution, maintain a `NOTICE` file per Apache 2.0 §4(d).

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Do NOT write a custom Code of Conduct. Fetch and use the official WB template:
https://github.com/worldbank/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

---

## CONTRIBUTING.md

Do NOT write a custom Contributing guide. Fetch and use the official WB template:
https://github.com/worldbank/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

## .env.example — Template

If the project uses environment variables (check for `os.getenv`, `process.env`, dotenv usage, etc.):

```bash
# .env.example
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.
# Do NOT commit your actual .env file.

# [Group: e.g., API Configuration]
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

# [Group: e.g., Database]
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

---

## Simple docs/index.md (for GitHub Pages)

If the user needs minimal web documentation to satisfy Requirement 5:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[Same description as README]

## Overview

[What this project does, who it's for, and why it exists]

## Getting Started

See the [README](https://github.com/worldbank/[repo-name]#readme) for installation and usage.

## User Guide

[Key documentation — be accessible to non-technical readers here]

## Contact

[Contact info]
```

To enable GitHub Pages from a `docs/` folder:
1. Push the file to `docs/index.md` (or `docs/index.html`) on the default branch
2. Go to GitHub repo Settings → Pages
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch", Branch = `main`, folder = `/docs`
4. Save — site publishes at `https://worldbank.github.io/[repo-name]`

## Bibliography template (optional, docs/bibliography.bib)

```bibtex
@article{author2024title,
  title   = {Full Paper Title},
  author  = {Author, First and Coauthor, Second},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year    = {2024},
  volume  = {1},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {1--10},
  doi     = {10.xxxx/xxxxx}
